# Serverless Framework Python HTTP API on AWS

This template demonstrates how to make a simple HTTP API with Python running on AWS Lambda and API Gateway using the Serverless Framework.

This template does not include any kind of persistence (database). For more advanced examples, check out the [serverless/examples repository](https://github.com/serverless/examples/) which includes DynamoDB, Mongo, Fauna and other examples.

## Usage

### Deployment

```
serverless deploy
```

After deploying, you should see output similar to:

```
Deploying "aws-python-http-api" to stage "dev" (us-east-1)

✔ Service deployed to stack aws-python-http-api-dev (85s)

endpoint: GET - https://6ewcye3q4d.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
functions:
  hello: aws-python-http-api-dev-hello (2.3 kB)
```

_Note_: In current form, after deployment, your API is public and can be invoked by anyone. For production deployments, you might want to configure an authorizer. For details on how to do that, refer to [http event docs](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway/).

### Invocation

After successful deployment, you can call the created application via HTTP:

```
curl https://xxxxxxx.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/
```

Which should result in response similar to the following (removed `input` content for brevity):

```json
{
  "message": "Go Serverless v4.0! Your function executed successfully!"
}
```

### Local development

You can invoke your function locally by using the following command:

```
serverless invoke local --function hello
```

Which should result in response similar to the following:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 200,
  "body": "{\n  \"message\": \"Go Serverless v4.0! Your function executed successfully!\"}"
}
```

Alternatively, it is also possible to emulate API Gateway and Lambda locally by using `serverless-offline` plugin. In order to do that, execute the following command:

```
serverless plugin install -n serverless-offline
```

It will add the `serverless-offline` plugin to `devDependencies` in `package.json` file as well as will add it to `plugins` in `serverless.yml`.

After installation, you can start local emulation with:

```
serverless offline
```

To learn more about the capabilities of `serverless-offline`, please refer to its [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline).

### Bundling dependencies

In case you would like to include 3rd party dependencies, you will need to use a plugin called `serverless-python-requirements`. You can set it up by running the following command:

```
serverless plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements
```

Running the above will automatically add `serverless-python-requirements` to `plugins` section in your `serverless.yml` file and add it as a `devDependency` to `package.json` file. The `package.json` file will be automatically created if it doesn't exist beforehand. Now you will be able to add your dependencies to `requirements.txt` file (`Pipfile` and `pyproject.toml` is also supported but requires additional configuration) and they will be automatically injected to Lambda package during build process. For more details about the plugin's configuration, please refer to [official documentation](https://github.com/UnitedIncome/serverless-python-requirements).


# Serlverless Framework Setup

### Python

```bash
# 1. Install or update python to version 3.8
# 2. cd to the directory where requirements.txt is located
# 3. Optional: activate your virtualenv
# 4. Run the following command to install required python packages
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Serverless

```bash
# Install Serverless taking wsl on windows as example
# 1. Updates ubuntu
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
# 2. Install node
sudo apt-get install curl -y
curl –sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_12.x | sudo -E bash -
sudo apt-get nodejs -y
# 3. Test node
node -v
# 4. Test npm
npm -v
# 5.1 Install the Serverless cli, if you do not have Serverless pre-installed
sudo npm install -g serverless
# 5.2 Update Serverless from a previous version of Serverless, if you already have installed Serverless
sudo npm update -g serverless
# 6 Check serverless framework version
serverless -v
```
```bash
# Install serverless plugins: prunes, python-requirements, dotenv and glue in one dev
# https://github.com/UnitedIncome/serverless-python-requirements
cd ${PROJECT_FOLDER}
sudo npm install serverless-prune-plugin serverless-python-requirements serverless-dotenv-plugin serverless-glue --save-dev
```
